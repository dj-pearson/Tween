ðŸš€ Development Phases
Phase 1: Extended Property Support (Quick Wins)
Let's start by expanding the tweenable properties since we have the infrastructure:
ðŸ§± Parts/Models - Add Missing Properties:
Orientation (Vector3)
Anchored flag detection (warning when not anchored)
CanCollide flag detection
ðŸŽ› UI Elements - Major Expansion:
BackgroundTransparency, TextTransparency, ImageTransparency
BackgroundColor3, TextColor3, ImageColor3
Rotation (number for UI)
ðŸ’¡ Lighting & Effects:
Light properties (Brightness, Range, Color)
Post-processing effects (Bloom, Blur, ColorCorrection)
ðŸ”Š Sound Properties:
Volume, PlaybackSpeed
Phase 2: Advanced Tween Controls (Core Features)
Chained Tweens - Queue multiple animations
